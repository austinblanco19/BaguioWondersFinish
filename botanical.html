        <p>Also known as the Igorot Village, the Botanical Garden features native huts typical of the type of Igorot dwellings found in the Cordilleras. The village is said to capture the ethnic spirit and cultural legacy of the Igorots and being tranquil and quiet, it is a nice place to just sit down and relax, take a leisurely stroll along its narrow and winding pathways and also enjoy the landscape where you will find numerous plants and trees.

Some years back Igorot dances and rituals were held in an improvised outdoor stage within the village. Local students go to the Botanical Garden for a day of retreat or just enjoy the outdoor environment. When visiting the Botanical Garden, you will usually find a group of Igorots at the main entrance who are dressed in their authentic native attire and regalia. They will be more than happy to pose with visitors for a souvenir picture ... of course, for a fee.</p>

       There are plants that are also sold at the Botanical Garden, however, before you decide to buy any, be aware that some of these plants may not be suitable for replanting in lowland areas where the climate is much more humid and warmer than that of Baguio. Just bear in mind that the city has an average elevation of about 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) above sea level with a temperature a number of degrees lower than that of Manila and the nearby provinces in northern Luzon. It will probably be best to just admire or take a photograph of the beautiful plants and colorful flowers that are abundantly seen and grown in Baguio.</p>
